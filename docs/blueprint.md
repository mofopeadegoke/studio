## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#293462) to convey professionalism and trust. The choice of a deep blue conveys the established, reputable image appropriate to a business- and social networking application, while avoiding overly common bright blues that feel less formal.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), near-white for a clean, modern look. The background color is of a similar hue to the primary color, but nearly desaturated.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#367E8C) for interactive elements and highlights, drawing users’ attention without overwhelming the formal aesthetic. This color is analogous to the primary, while still differing noticeably in saturation and brightness.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for a modern look with a touch of warmth, used throughout for readability.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif to maintain the professional design style.
- Use professional, clear icons with a consistent style across the application to aid navigation and provide visual cues.
- Implement a clean, responsive layout with intuitive navigation menus and well-organized sections for easy access to user profiles, community forums, and resource libraries.
- Incorporate subtle hover effects and transitions to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience, ensuring animations are smooth and professional.
